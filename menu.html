                    <li>
                        We prepare three different varieties of Rice daily which include coconut, jollof, Ofada, and fried rice. It is also an incredibly simple dish, making it perfect for everyday meals. It is commonly served alongside a serving of vegetables, meat such as chicken or beef, or fried fish and ponmo kika. <img src="https://wazobiaafricankitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/food34.jpg" alt="jollof Rice" width="510" height="450" title="Jollof Rice"><img src="https://nosakfamili.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lunch-Inspiration.jpg" alt="jollof Rice" width="430" height="450" title="Jollof Rice"><img src="https://www.msingiafrikamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A327.jpg" alt="Jollof Rice" width="450" height="450" title="Jollof Rice"></li>
                    <h3>Soup </h3>    
                    <li>
                        Soups consumed in the country’s various regions include Banga soup, Miyan Kuka, Okro soup, Ewedu soup, Pepper soup, Egusi soup, Afang, and Edikan Ikon soup.The ingredients used to prepare them range from local ingredients such as processed locust beans (Iru), to vegetables, such as spinach, waterleaf, bitter leaf, and pumpkin leaves. However, due to international influence in the Nigerian food culture by Portuguese, British, Dutch, and other European traders in the early days, spices such as Thyme, Curry, Ginger, Nutmeg, Cloves, Habanero pepper, and Scotch Bonnet are also used.
                        Vegetable Soup (Efo riro) is a typical Yoruba dish. It’s a quick and straightforward way to prepare and enjoy fresh, green, and leafy vegetables, such as spinach or pumpkin leaves, with beef, chicken, or smoked fish. Efo riro makes a great partner for African fufu such as Eba (garri), Semo, and Amala. It is reputed to have health benefits because it is rich in iron and can help treat iron deficiency anemia. <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ohrzARIL61o/XZK7d3lZ4iI/AAAAAAAACBM/o53ryarenT8fECiDgYl8xRKmvcDtvLSjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Afang+soup.jpg" alt="Vegetable and pundo yam" width="510" height="450" title="Vegetable soup"><img src="https://beyahfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EFO-RIRO-1024x576.jpg" alt="Vegetable soup" width="430" height="450" title="Vegetable soup"><img src="https://africannearyou.com/wp-content/uploads/listing-uploads/gallery/2020/07/inbound3094057793106346358.jpg" alt="Egusi Soup" width="450" height="450" title="Egusi soup">

                    <h3>Amala and Ewedu</h3>
                    <li>Amala and Ewedu Soup is a delicious soup traditionally associated with the Yoruba people of Western Nigeria. It is, however, a very popular delicacy throughout the country. Ewedu soup is made from the leaves of a Jute plant that is blended into a glutinous consistency (similar to okra soup). It’s typically garnished with meat and ponmo (cowskin) and best served with Amala. A tomato-pepper sauce is sometimes served with Ewedu to counteract the slight bitterness of the Jute plant leaves.</li><img src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/4561459_img20160927232758_jpegc03abad8aa732b52788c29de3e83a72f" alt="Amala and Ewedu" width="510" height="450" title="Amala and ewedu"><img src="https://afiaghana.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nigerian-food-afiaghana.jpg" alt="Mix" width="430" height="450" title="varieties"><img src="https://golden-suites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pounded-Yam-with-Egusi-Soup.jpg" alt="Efo and Iyan" width="450" height="450" title="Efo and Iyan">
